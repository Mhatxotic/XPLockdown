# Lockdown

This is a utility that will shutdown all pointless services on Windows XP. It will also completely disable DCOM. The ending result is that ZERO network ports are in the LISTENING state so the installation is protected from internet intrusions when directly connected to the internet or from other devices on the LAN.

It is assumed that you have a wired network connection as this will shutdown wireless access but you can re-enable the related wireless services again after manually if you wish.
